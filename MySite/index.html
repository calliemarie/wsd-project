		<h3>A Tradition of Excellence</h3>
			
			<p>The Oklahoma Sooners represent the University of Oklahoma, located in Norman, Oklahoma.  Currently the team is in the Big 12 conference.  The Sooners started playing football in 1895.  OU's current coach is Bob Stoops, who is in his 13th year as head coach.  The last game the Sooners played was a win against Iowa State in the 2011 InSight Bowl.  The Sooners play on Owen Field, in the Gaylord Family - Oklahoma Memorial Stadium.   The stadium currently holds 82,112 Faithful Sooner Fans, making it the 14th largest college stadium in the United States.  Being a Sooner Faithful is more than just loving Sooner Football.  It's about living for the next game.  It's about hating Texas, no matter what.  It's about DVRing the game to watch that play again, again and again.  It's about the <span>Crimson</span> and Cream.  It's about <strong>Boomer Sooner</strong>. </p>
